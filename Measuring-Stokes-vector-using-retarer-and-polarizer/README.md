The scripts here can be used to evaluate the Stokes parameters according to the method described in the bachelor thesis in the section 'Measuring Stokes vectors using one retarder and a polarizer'. For this method to work a calibration measurement of either linearly or circularly polarized light is necessary in order to determine beta_0 and be able to evaluate any measurement afterwards. For both types of calibration measurements there is a script as the determination of beta_0 from linearly polarized light differs from that for circularly polarized light.

+Nevertheless, the script for circularly polarized light as a calibration measurement should be used, because it has a calculation of +errors and is better documented
