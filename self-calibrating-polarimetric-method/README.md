Here the script used for the evaluation of the self-calibrating-method proposed by Andreev(2017) and described in the bachelor thesis is introduced. Two calibration measurements for horizontally polarized light are required, where in the first case the second linear polarizer is set at 0 degree and for the second case the linear polarizer is set at 45 degree. From that the calibration parameters are obtained and a subsequent analyze of any polarization is possible. The required measurements need to be set in their respective sections, if this is the case the programm needs to be run one time to evalute the Stokes parameters of a measurement
